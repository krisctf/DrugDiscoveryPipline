# Drug Discovery Pipeline Repository

Welcome to the Drug Discovery Pipeline repository, a comprehensive toolkit designed to streamline and optimize the drug discovery process within our biotech company. This repository serves as a central hub for managing and executing various stages of drug discovery, from initial compound screening to lead optimization. It provides a structured and efficient framework to accelerate the identification and development of potential therapeutic agents.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several modules, each dedicated to a specific phase of the drug discovery pipeline. These modules are designed to work seamlessly together, creating a cohesive and integrated workflow for drug discovery scientists and researchers. The key modules include:

- **Compound Library Management:** Catalog and manage compound libraries for easy access.
- **High-Throughput Screening (HTS):** Facilitate large-scale screening of compounds against specific targets or assays.
- **Hit Identification:** Identify promising compounds with desired biological activity.
- **Lead Optimization:** Optimize lead compounds to enhance pharmacological properties.
- **ADME Assessment:** Predict pharmacokinetics and toxicology of lead compounds.
- **In Silico Modeling:** Predict binding affinity using computational methods.
- **Data Integration and Visualization:** Integrate and visualize data for informed decision-making.
- **Reporting and Documentation:** Generate reports and maintain documentation.
