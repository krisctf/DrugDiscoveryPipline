This script defines a function structure_search that takes a library database path and a chemical structure query as input and returns a list of compounds matching the query structure. You'll need to implement the database connection and search logic based on your database system (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL) and chemical structure search algorithm (e.g., substructure search).

To use this script, you can run it from the command line, providing the path to the library database and the chemical structure query. For example:

python structure_search.py library.db 'C1=CC=CC=C1'
