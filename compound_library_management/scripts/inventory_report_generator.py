This script defines a function generate_inventory_report that takes the library database path and an output report file path as input and generates a report on the compound inventory. You'll need to implement the database connection, data retrieval, and report generation logic based on your database system (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL) and reporting requirements.

To use this script, you can run it from the command line, providing the paths to the library database and the output report file. For example:

python inventory_report_generator.py library.db inventory_report.csv
