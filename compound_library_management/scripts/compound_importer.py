'''This script defines a function import_compounds that reads compound data from a CSV file and inserts it into a library database. You'll need to implement the database connection and insertion logic based on your database system (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL).

To use this script, you can run it from the command line, providing the paths to the input CSV file containing compound data and the library database where you want to import the compounds. For example:

python compound_importer.py input_data.csv library.db
